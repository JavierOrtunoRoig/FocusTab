# Focus Tab

## Description

Focus Tab is a modern, intuitive browser extension designed to revolutionize how users interact with new browser tabs. By replacing the default new tab page with a customizable, highly functional dashboard, Focus Tab aims to boost productivity and provide quick access to essential tools and information.

## Key Features

- Customizable Widgets: Add widgets such as weather forecasts, task lists, and bookmark groups.
- Personalization: Adjust layouts, colors, and functionality to suit your needs.
- Minimalist Design: A sleek, distraction-free interface to keep users focused.
- Future Synchronization: (Coming soon) Sync settings and widgets across devices.

## Motivation

Focus Tab was inspired by the observation that many existing new tab extensions lack regular updates, modern designs, or essential features. For instance, while Start.me is popular, it has not received significant updates in years, leaving room for innovation.

Focus Tab aims to:

- Deliver a seamless, updated experience leveraging modern web technologies.
- Empower users to personalize their productivity dashboards.
- Combine essential tools like weather, task lists, and bookmarks into one interface.
- Provide a fresh, reliable alternative to outdated solutions.
